## About the Project

This project focuses on exploring the capabilities of Liquid Time Constant (LTC) neural networks for continual learning approaches, utilizing the Mammoth library.
LTC neural networks are known for their ability to adapt and learn from new data over time, making them suitable for tasks that require continual learning without forgetting previously acquired knowledge.

This project tries expore the capabilities of Liquid Time Constant (LTC) neural networks for continual learning using the Mammoth library. 
It extends its scope to include the application of explainable AI methods to comprehend the decision-making processes of LTC models.

### Explainable AI Integration

Understanding the decision-making process of neural networks is crucial, especially in real-world applications where transparency and interpretability are essential. The project employs methods of explainable AI to shed light on how CFC and LTC models arrive at their decisions. This not only enhances the interpretability of the models but also provides insights into the factors influencing their behavior.
### Real-world Application

To ensure the practical relevance of the research, the project applies these models and explainability methods to industrial data. 
By doing so, it aims to go beyond the typical benchmark datasets, addressing challenges and complexities inherent in real-world scenarios.
This real-world use case serves as a valuable testbed for assessing the models' effectiveness in environments with dynamic and evolving data.

The combination of continual learning, explainable AI, and real-world application sets this project apart, offering a comprehensive exploration of LTC neural networks and their applicability in industrial contexts.
